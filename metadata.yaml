description: The result of over forty years of passionate research, <i>Montcalm and
  Wolfe</i> is the epic story of Europe's struggle for dominance of the New World.
  Centuries of rivalry and greed between the great imperial powers culminated in five
  brutal years of war; resulted in the death of both generals, Louis de Montcalm and
  James Wolfe; and ultimately sowed the seeds of the American Revolution, fought a
  scant seventeen years later. A brilliant work of scholarship as well as a riveting
  read, <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i> was thought by many, including the author, to be
  Parkman's greatest work. It is an essential part of any military history collection.
  The books in the Modern Library War series have been chosen by series<br>editor
  Caleb Carr according to the significance of their subject matter, their contribution
  to the field of military history, and their literary merit.
